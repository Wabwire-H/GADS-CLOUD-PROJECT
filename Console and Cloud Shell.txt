#Lab Console and Cloud Shell
##Objectives
#In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

-Get access to Google Cloud.

-Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

-Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

#Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.
1. Create a bucket using the Cloud Console
	gsutil mb gs://bark_at
Results: creates a bucket called 'bark_at'

2. Create a second bucket and verify in the Cloud shell
	gsutil mb gs://bark_at2
#Listing created buckets
	gsutil ls
Results
The second bucket should be displayed in the Buckets list.

4. Explore more Cloud Shell features
 Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM
	gsutil cp C:\Users\User\Documents\gadsproject.txt gs://bark_at/
Results: Uploads a txt file named gads project to the bucket 'bark_at'

5.confirm that the file was uploaded
	ls
#Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
1.To list available regions, execute the following command:
	gcloud compute regions list
2.Select a region from the list and note the value in any text editor.
	Type in the numeric value that corresponds to your region.
#This region will now be referred to as [YOUR_REGION] in the remainder of the lab.

1.Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:
	egINFRACLASS_REGION=us-west1-a
2.Verify it with echo
	echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

#Append the environment variable to a file
1.Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class
	mkdir infraclass
2.Create a file called config in the infraclass directory
	touch infraclass/config
3.Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:
	echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config
4.Create a second environment variable for your Project ID,replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID.
	INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=qwiklabs-gcp-04-fd10cb096a09
5.Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:
	echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config
6.Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:
	source infraclass/config
	echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
7.Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:
	exit
#Reopen cloud shell by clicking >_

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
Results:There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.

#Modify the bash profile and create persistence
1.Edit the shell profile with the following command:
	nano .profile

2.Add the following line to the end of the file:
	source infraclass/config
3.Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
4.Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.
5.Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:
	echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
Results:You should now see the expected value that you set in the config file.
